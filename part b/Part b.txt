 Question 1: 

  HTTP itself doesn't remember anything between requests - it's stateless. So when you log into a website, the next page you visit wouldn't know you're
  logged in. That's where sessions and cookies come in. When you first visit a site, the server creates a session ID (like a unique ticket number) and
  sends it to your browser as a cookie. Your browser saves this cookie and sends it back with every request. The server uses that session ID to look up
  your information - whether you're logged in, what's in your shopping cart, etc.

  In Django, this happens automatically through middleware. The session data is stored server-side (usually in the database or cache), while only the
  session ID lives in the cookie on your browser. This is more secure than storing everything in cookies because sensitive data stays on the server.
  Django also uses CSRF tokens to prevent malicious sites from making requests on your behalf. For authentication, Django checks if your session has a
  user ID attached to it. If it does, you're logged in. This is how websites "remember" you even though HTTP doesn't.



Question 2:

  Moving a Django app from SQLite to MariaDB takes a few steps. First, you need to install MariaDB on your server and create a database. Then you need
  to install the Python connector - usually mysqlclient using pip. Next, you edit the DATABASES setting in settings.py, changing from SQLite to MariaDB
  with your database name, username, password, host, and port.

  Once that's configured, you run python manage.py makemigrations to create migration files based on your models, then python manage.py migrate to apply
  them to MariaDB. The main difference from SQLite is that MariaDB is a proper database server, so you need credentials and it runs separately. You
  might run into issues with character encoding - setting it to utf8mb4 is recommended. Also, MariaDB handles some field types differently than SQLite,
  so you might need to adjust certain model fields. It's good practice to test migrations on a development database first before running them on
  production. You can also use python manage.py dumpdata to export data from SQLite and loaddata to import it into MariaDB if you're migrating existing
  data.
